🚀 SarkarFlow

Automated Government Service Request Routing Backend

An event-driven backend system built using Motia to automate citizen service request routing, SLA tracking, escalation, and audit logging for government services in India.

📌 Problem Statement

In India, government service requests such as electricity issues, water complaints, or municipal problems are often handled manually.
This leads to:

Delayed responses

Missed SLAs

Lack of transparency

Poor accountability

SarkarFlow solves this by introducing an automated, event-driven backend system that routes complaints, tracks SLAs, escalates delays, and maintains a full audit trail — without manual intervention.

💡 Solution Overview

SarkarFlow uses Motia’s event-driven workflow engine to manage the entire lifecycle of a government service request.

Instead of hardcoding business logic inside controllers:

Events trigger workflows

Workflows manage routing, timing, and escalation

Policies drive decisions

Logs ensure traceability

This architecture is scalable, transparent, and production-ready.

🔐 Authentication

SarkarFlow uses API Key authentication to secure endpoints.

Request Header
x-api-key: SARKARFLOW_SECURE_KEY


Unauthorized requests are automatically rejected.

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sarkarflow.git
cd sarkarflow

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
npm install

3️⃣ Environment Variables

Create a .env file:

PORT=3000
SARKARFLOW_API_KEY=SARKARFLOW_SECURE_KEY

4️⃣ Run Locally
npm start

🐳 Docker Setup
Build Image
docker build -t sarkarflow .

Run Container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env sarkarflow

📊 Logging & Audit Trail

All workflows write structured logs

Escalations are logged separately

Audit workflow maintains a complete event trail

Logs help with debugging, monitoring, and compliance
